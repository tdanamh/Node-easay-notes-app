# Node.js Notes App


This is a project for school in which I used JavaScript and node.js.
I created an API with node.js which implements CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) for notes.
I used AJAX to call the API for creating users, creating notes, get all the notes, delete a note, delete all the notes.
With JavaScript I created all the inputs.
I used regex to validate emails and passwords.
I used Local Storage to remember the user's favorite color.
Each user can modify the background-color with a color-picker.
I used the library SweetAlert2 for errors and creating elements (notes, users).
